APL-lib
=======

APL-lib is a collection of APL libraries that provide much of the
functionality of other scripting languages.

APL is a functional programming language originally proposed in the
1950s and implemented by IBM in the 1960s.  Several APL interpreters
are available see http://www.sigapl.org/

APL uses a suite of operators and functions represented by special
characters and many APL vendors use proprietary file formats.  Files
in the library are utf-8 encoding where APL's special characters are
stored with their Unicode value.  

To display these files one must have an appropriate font installed.
The Free Software Foundation offers one at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/unifont/
